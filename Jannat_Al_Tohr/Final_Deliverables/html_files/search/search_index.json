As the design of the muqarnas is already described in 2_Forming, this chapter will only contain the construction of them. As the muqarnas are also used in the corridors, also the design of corridors and their construction is put in this chapter. Muqarnas construction As the dome is made out of muqarnas, first the elements has to be made. The muqarnas elements could be build using moulds. One large difference in construction is that these \"adobe 2.0\" elements arent particurally made by the people in the camp. This dome can be constructed with some simple tools and maybe a little larger foamwork. Because of this, this construction technique is not implemented, as it is not the purpose of the muqarna dome. Fig. 1: The different foamworks There are 4 different elements in shape. The only difference between these elements for each levels are in their height . Fig. 2: The resulting elements First the moulds are built with the height of the biggest element. Then a piece of wood is placed with the height needed for each level. This wood piece also could be used as a grip for when these are moved to their places and for a bit of inter locking. Fig. 3: Apply the foamwork with the wooden piece Fig. 4: Fill the foamwork to get the elements After putting the elements out of the mould after some time the not needed parts could be cut off. To construct the dome, each row of the dome has to be complete first to go to the next one. Fig. 5: Start placing the elements After making three rows more clay has to be added to the back of the muqarnas to both make it smooth and to make it more structurally stable. Fig. 6: Apply the second roof each 3 rows to increase strength during building And it has to be continued till the dome is finished. Fig. 7: Final dome In the process this has also been realised, giving a nice model muqarnas-dome. Fig. 8: Model of the muqarnas dome The corridors In the ruleset the corridors are very important. In the beginnning a triangle is kept inbetween each hexagon to ensure the existing of corridors. The corridors became \"less important\" for a long time, as the focus was on the hexagons. Until an extensive calculation of the structural behaviour of these corridors there was not really a problem. Figure 8 shows the eventual calculations and they show that there is an necessity of looking better into the corridors. There is a lot of stress in the corners which might be dangerous for the building. Fig. 9: Stresses in the vaults This required another approach towards the corridors. The eventual result was that in stead of making complicated vaults, normal, rectangular vaults are created. They are easy to build and most likely a lot more sturdier. This leaves with a lot of asymmetrical connection pieces. These are very hard to build with normal bricks, so here also muqarnas are used. Fig. 10: Rectangular vaults around the corridors For the corridor junction and ending there are four different shape for muqarnas elements. They are made from the moulds just the way the dome elements are made.

Fig. 12: Eventual building of the corridors Construction of the corridors To make the corridors vaults first the shape has to be drawn on the ground by a rope then it is given at least a 10 cm thickness. Then workers have to make a mold using or rectangular bricks, and then make it smooth on inside using clay. After drying they place some straw and reeds inside and pour gypsum in the mold.

This chapter will focus on how the domes are built. First the tesselation is discussed and how this should be translated into bricklaying. Lastly the construction of the domes will be explained. Flowchart In the 0_Introduction chapter the whole process of the design was shown. There were 5 groups that were dealt with individually. Last chapter resulted in the extruded walls, including openings. Until now, all bricklaying choices are made with triangular bricks. For the flowchart, the main dome will be handled individually with muqarnas. This chapter is about all the other domes. Fig. 2: Flowchart of the openings Then for all the elements bricklaying needs to be developed, both in detail as in construction methods. The choice is made with several considerations. These are shown in the following flowchart. Fig. 3: Bricklaying considerations Tesselation In Rule N15 the ceiling are applied. In this step, no further rules are applied, other than: Triangular tessellation of corridors and domes area without the wall thickness Move the surfaces 2.4 meters up from the floors Set outlines of the surfaces as anchor lines Apply dynamic relaxation Fig. 4: Domes in shape To apply dynamic relaxation, tesselation has to be applied onto the mesh. The mesh is a dome with a hexagon as the base. Fig. 5: GIF of applying different tesselations Fig. 6: Top view of all the tesselations Four different types of tesselation were made, and they are repeated several times. All the tesselations have different results when analysing them to stresses. From this, the \"best\" tesselation can be taken to calculate further in the structural report. Fig. 7: Stresses in the different tesselations As seen in figure 7, triangulating will create stresses in the edges, what is not beneficial. Also triangulating by snub+0 will result in a lot of stress. By quickly looking at it, performing quadsplit is very good for the dome. For the remainder of the design, the choice fell on \"all constant quad split\", as it performs best. The 3rd tesselation is assumed to be the the dome shape. Later on, this shape was translated to an simpler triangulated tesselation. Fig. 8: Triangular tesselation Bricklaying For bricklaying there are a few options to consider. Firstly, are ribs needed? Secondly, what pattern will be used and lastly how does this work with the chosen tesselation. When looking at traditional architecture with domes, usually ribs aren't needed, unless the diameter is a little higher. As the diameters in this project are small enough, assumed is that no ribs are needed. The idea of using a fishbone pattern comes from a reference from the Jameh Mosque of Isfahan, where a dome is created with fishbone structure. It looks very nice and has some great possibilities when building with it. Also, using this method allows for slightly sturdier domes as the bricks are a bit locked in place due to the pattern. Fig. 9: Fishbone reference When developing the script to make this, one big problem arose. Using the tesselation of figure 8, the normals of the points are changing quite heavily on the edges of faces. For this reason, another approach was needed to be used. For bricklaying there are two options, first divide the tesselation into very tiny faces so that the normals make sense. Or create a new mesh that nearly gets to the desired shape. Another problem that came was the constructability. There is no way residents of the camp can build very complicated shapes, like the tesselation that was proposed. It would be ideal if the dome was a spherical shape, so with simple tools this could actually be built. There are two possibilities to solve this. First change the dome shape, by using for instance pendentives. This is often used, but clashes with the triangular bricks and only made matters worse. Another option is to change the wall slowly into a circle, but laos this clashed with the triangular bricks. Eventually the decision fell that the dome should be split in two different shapes. This resulted in the domeshape seen in figure 7. It is nearly the same shape as the tesselation, but exists of two different shapes. First there is an compression belt that lofts between the hexagon and is made by normal \"flat bricks\" (headers and stretchers) , see figure 8. As it lofts into a circle, a \"normal\" spherical dome can be placed on top, using fishbone techniques. Fig. 7: Stresses in the different tesselations Fig. 8: Headers and strethers in compression belt For the project a script was developed that developed this brick pattern. The script for wall bricklaying If clicking doesn't download, please save the link as a .gh file Construction This chapter will contain the steps taken to build the dome. After the walls and openings have been laid down it time to start the domes. In figure 9 one sees the first part of the dome construction, the compression belt that makes the transition from hexagon to circle. To construct this part of the dome on would need a Fathy compass, (see fig 10), and six straight rod/bars with a length equal to the width of the wall. Fig. 9: The compression belt as loft between hexagon and circle Fig. 10: The use of the fathy The first step is to raise the Fathy so that it touches on top of the wall. Than measures out the circle that touches all the six corners of the room. In the six corners of the wall place the rod so that they start in the center of the wall and angle they that they align with the circle of the Fathy compass. Starting out from the corners and lay the brick until you have approximated the circle made by the Fathy compass (see fig 10). In fig.. The top part of the dome with the fishbone dome masonry pattern. To lay the top part of the dome we start we one brick laid flat on its side flat and use that to angle the next brick against, after a couple of bricks the friction and weight will make it that the first angled brick cannot move as easily anymore. Using the Fathy compass makes sure that the top part of the bricks are in the right angle. The tricky part comes after a full circle when one needs to get the first brick out, the one that\u2019s laid out flat. By this time the mortar between the brick should have dried enough that the masonry doesn\u2019t fall over like dominoes. Now one can start laying the second layer in the other direction, for example if you oriented the first layer clockwise now you lay them counter clockwise. Remember to check orientation of the brick every now and then with the Fathy compass.

It involves creating a ruleset for the floorplan, as well to go into the heigth. It follows our design process and how this process could be repeated for following Hammam. Our idea was that there will be more Hammam in the camp and that and computational process is needed to develop these. For this purpose we developed this ruleset, or pseudocode. We explained how the whole process is done and at #our_translation shows how we implemented this ruleset into the design that was our product. The Ruleset This chapter explains how we translated the bubble diagram to a 3D-shape. To make this translation, we used a ruleset to determine the overall shape of the building. We assume that there is no \"one best design\" but many possible good designs. Also, as described in #Location Finding, the main idea is to realise more of these Hammam. For this purpose we need several approaches with possible outcomes, depending on some parameters. The ruleset follows the following rules: Rule N01: Create the triangular grid of 1.6m Fig. 1: Rule N01: Create the triangular grid of 1.6m The functions are all hosted into hexagonal rooms because hexagons: - Are compatible with domes shapes - Are related to the typology of Hammams The hexagonal grid is translated into a triangular grid as triangles can form hexagons and hexagons can be divided into triangles. Also, the triangular grid is more flexible than a hexagonal grid. In the beginning a grid of equilateral triangles with sides of 1.2m sided is applied, because their height is equal to 1m as the width of corridors or openings. In later steps a triangular grid of 1.6 meter is found to be more suitable because in earthy structures the walls have a considerable thickness. Rule N02: Place the bubble diagram in the grid Fig. 2: Rule N02: Place the bubble diagram in the grid Rule N03: Define push/pull points of the functions Within this rule, we assume three \"function-groups\" that follow the Program of Requirements. Entrance (functions): Entrance_reception washing (m) washing (f) g_wc Childcare (functions): ch_common_room ch_care_room ch_equip ch_washing ch_group_room ch_storage_room ch_open_space Hammam (functions): h_dressing room h_sub1_tea h_sub2_cleaning h_hal h_sub4 water_tanks_tech h_hot house h_sub5_private washing room H_sub6_hot_pool H_sub7_cold_pool h_sub8_wc Fig. 3: Rule N03: Define push/pull points of the functions Define the pull point of entrance (functions). Define the middle of the grid as the pull point of the garden Then, develop the Hammam (functions) and childcare (functions) in opposite directions. They are placed from the entrance and are placed in a way that they surround the garden. The center point of the plot acts as push point to achieve the biggest garden possible Rule N04: Change the bubble diagram according to the push and pull points and leave one row of triangle distance between the bubbles Fig. 4: Rule N04: Change the bubble diagram according to the push and pull points and leave one row of triangle distance between the bubbles Rule N05: Place the functions in hexagonal rooms Fig. 5: Rule N05: Place the functions in hexagonal rooms Rule N06: Define the corridor area between the hexagons Fig. 6: Rule N06: Define the corridor area between the hexagons A triangle is a corridor if the triangle: - has 2 out of 3 corners that are attached to 2 different hexagons - is needed to achieve the connections between the functions according to the bubble diagram (step 4). The shortest path is chosen - could avoid dead corners happening somewhere in the building Fig. 8: The result, where the grey areas are corridors Rule N07: Define the semi-open space Fig. 9: Rule N07: Define the semi-open space The semi-open space is made out of the two triangle rows that are more close to the hexagons and corridors. If a corner-edge is 60\u00b0, Then the triangle on the corner that belongs to the garden is added to the semi-open space Rule N08: Define the type of connection between the rooms Fig. 10: Rule N08: Define the type of connection between the rooms For this connection, we see 4 different possibilities to connect rooms: - Direct connection, a normal door or arch - Indirect connection, a window or perforated wall - Long-distance connection, a corridor or the stoa - No connection Rule N09: Draw the wall-lines Fig. 11: Rule N09: Draw the wall-lines Wall-lines are drawn according to the type of connections. Switch (connectionType): - case Direct connection = expansion + 1 * door_opening The triangles are taken by one hexagon and a door opening is created in the common wall. - case Indirect connection = 2 * door_opening Two door openings, that are not facing each other, are created in each wall of the two rooms - case Long-distance connection = 2 * door_opening The triangles of the corridor that connect the two rooms are remaining as corridor and door openings are placed in the rooms to achieve connection - case No connection = expansion The triangles of the corridor are taken by one room Add emergency exist door openings in the corridors where needed Fig. 12: This gives the following floorplan (the result of the configuration) Rule N10: Adjust the foorheights Fig. 13: Rule N10: Adjust the foorheights The deeper the floorheight of a room is the more privacy and stable temperature is needed. For the groups and names of the spaces, see rule N03. So the floorheights are adjusted as following: - Fl_h (semi_open_sp) == 0.0m - Fl_h (entrance (functions) + childcare (functions)) == 0.0m - Fl_h (hammam(h_dressing room, h_sub1_tea, h_sub2_cleaning, h_sub8_wc, h_hal, h_sub4 water_tanks_tech)) == -0.3m - Fl_h (hammam(h_hot house)) == -0.6m - Fl_h(hammam(h_sub6_hot pool h_sub7_cold pool h_sub5_private washing room)) == -0.9m Corridors are getting the floorheight of the neighboring hexagon that has the lowest floor height Rule N11: Add wall thickness and wall height Fig. 14: Rule N11a: Add wall thickness and wall height In the hexagons the wall thickness will be added in the inside. Hexagons with side length: - Hex_side == 1 * grid_size = wall_thickness == 0.5m - Hex_side == 2 * grid_size = wall_thickness == 0.8m - Hex_side == 3 * grid_size = wall_thickness == 1.0m - Hex_side == 4 * grid_size = wall_thickness == 1.2m Wall_semi-open_sp = wall_thickness == 1.0m offseted both-sided If corridor_side == no_wall = wall_thickness == 0.5m offseted inside Wall height is 2.4 from floorheight Fig. 15: Rule N11b: Offset wallthickness to the semi open space Fig. 16: Rule N11c: Result of the wallthickness Rule N12: Add supports of semi-open space as following Fig. 17: Rule N12: Add supports of semi-open space as following length_side == grid_size = side == wall_support corner \u2260 wall_support_corners = corner == column_support grid_size length_side \u2264 3 * grid_size = no support 3 * grid_size length_side - length_side == number_even * grid_size = wall_support - length_side == number_odd * grid_size = column_support Fig. 18: Result until now Rule N13: Add door openings Fig. 19: Rule N13: Add door openings Diagonal extrusion is used in the wall, it ensures privacy and is easier to build. Placing of the door openings is bases on the configuration plan The size of the door opening is equal to the largest opening size that can be achieved in the smallest hexagon Rule N14: Add small ventilation openings Fig. 20: Rule N14: Add small ventilation openings Small openings are added in sides where no door is placed and in: - In every side of the hexagons that is attached in its whole length with the semi-open space - In every side of the hexagons that is part of the building outline - In every side of the corridor that is in a dead end Rule N15: Create the ceilings Fig. 21: Rule N15: Create the ceilings Triangular tessellation of corridors and domes area without the wall thickness Move the surfaces 2.4 meters up from the floors Set outlines of the surfaces as anchor lines Apply dynamic relaxation Rule N16: Add ceiling openings Fig. 22: Rule N16: Add ceiling openings For the domes: At the highest point, which is the middle of the dome For the corridors: In the middle of the triangles that are in neighboring with 3 other triangles of the same corridor In the middle of the triangles that are one grid size away from the buildings outline Rule N17: Create the 2nd roof Fig. 23: Rule N17: Create the 2nd roof Move the hexagonal and triangular boundaries 2.4m up from the their floorheigths If two lines are same in top view, Then Check their heights If they have different heights, Then remove the line that has the lowest height Else remove one line randomly Place points on the lines with equal distances in top view Move the points in Z-direction The length of the movement is higher if the horizontal distance of the point to the closest the building outline or the garden outline is high. Offset the support lines of the semi-open space by 0.8 inside the garden Add the above points and lines as anchor components Tesselate triangular the roofing surface Fig. 24: Final mesh without simplifications Apply dynamic and simplify the surface Simplify further in Meshmixer Fig. 25: Final mesh Our approach We also applied this ruleset/design process into our program. The GIF below shows the implementation of this process that led to our design. It is the basic shape, we will later implement some other pieces to make Adobe 2.0. Overall, the ruleset already gives a shape of a buildable Hammam. Fig. 26: Implementations of the rules For this project a script was developed that included all of our approach. Go to scripts Adobe 2.0 As described above, we want to implement some \"interesting pieces\" that push the use of the adobe to more extremes, or Adobe 2.0. In the GIF above, it is clearly seen that we implement the stoa inside the design, although it is not in the ruleset. We consider the stoa to be a very interesting piece of the Hammam and would like to see it being constructed on a new level of adobe use. Secondly, we see great potential in the largest dome and how to construct this. Looking into traditional architecture and their design could help understanding how this could be done. The stoa Fig. 27: Section of the Hammam with the stoa in it The Semi-open space that surrounds the garden, seen in Figure 27, is an important element because of its climate and social aspect. It is a wide corridor that connects all the functions but also provides a shaded area around the garden where the users can relax and socialize. The width of the semi-open space is getting larger next to the tea room where more area is needed. Its openings are defined by a script, that is taking into consideration the structural weaknesses of the shape and creates as larger openings as possible. The openings and their columns are written in the ruleset, where the larger openings are tried to be created. The stoa is rested on columns on the garden-side and on the other side on the wall. Rule N11 includes an offset for walls on the stoa side. Once the supports and openings are defined the ceiling is calculated by dynamic relaxation. For more inforation about the tesselation of the stoa and all structural behaviour of this piece check out our structural report at our structural report page . Fig. 28: Stresses in the dynamic relaxed stoa As can be seen there are some stresses and the shape isn't perfect for compression-only building. Therefore, its thickness is structurally optimized. In this way the final shape of the semi-open space is constructed. Fig. 29: Ideal thicknesses of the stoa Fig. 30: Stresses in the thickness adjusted stoa Murqarnas For this project a script was developed that included all of our approach. Go to scripts There were several approaches to designing the hothouse, where the first was from a geometrical perspective. The hexagon is translated into a normal dome using pendentives. Technically this is the same technique that is used for the normal domes but with a bit nicer translation. Fig. 31: Geometrical perspective; a normal dome on top of pendentives When tesselating the dome and using prisms as small voxels, the dome could start looking like muqarnas. This was the first approach towards reaching the desired muqarnas. Also the pendentives are given a diameter to translate the whole dome into a 3D object. Fig. 32: Geometrical perspective; a normal dome with small prisms Then the Karbandi was combined with the Murqarnas dome. Already it became clear how nice muqarnas could look and how great the potential was. The following picture has clearly repetitive elements that combined form the dome. Fig. 33: Geometrical perspective; a section and bottom view of the muqarna potential The last step in the geometrical approach was also implementing muqarnas on the pendentives. The whole dome now consists of these elements and looks like the following figure. Fig. 34: Geometrical perspective; the whole dome translated into muqarnas From this approach a few things could be learned. Firstly, the geometrical way isn't ideal, as it cannot be combined with the tessellation and is still a normal dome on top of pendentives. Building these can be very hard and might only make matters worse. Secondly, the geometry cannot be simulated easily. To adjust the height and width of the form finding geometry, sliders are used. Also, having the dynamic relaxed shape as input for our dome is prefered. Lastly, this will also follow the other reasons a bit, the geometrical approach only works with point-symmetrical shapes. Concluded, it is important to take the shape of the dome as input. Or using the tessellation or by using the dynamic relaxed mesh. So first the dynamic relaxed mesh is used as input of the dome. When extruding the grid (of 0.4 meter) into the Z-direction, prisms can be created and then intersected with the relaxed geometry. This should then give the prisms as bounding boxes of the muqarnas, whereafter the muqarna structure can be implemented. Fig. 35: Topological perspective: A dome created out of prisms It can be seen that this is not the ideal way of creating this shape. The height is here put into a solid distance, but also when making variable heights, it will be messy. The picture shows a lot of weird prisms on the long edges that are problematic. The whole shape is not point-symmetric anymore. The other disadvantage is that the dome doesn't follow the tessellation. Next the tessellation as input is tried to create the dome. Fig. 36: Topological perspective: A dome created out of the tessellation As can be seen the problem with this approach is, that it is following the logic of muqarnas in opposite direction. And instead of giving thickness to the lower levels it is giving thickness to upper ones so it is not constructable. After this, the tessellation is divided for each layer. However this produces unexpected errors at the corners and in addition it works only for simple symmetrical shapes. Fig. 37: Topological perspective: A dome created out of layered tessellation In the last approach each offset of the mesh tessellation was defined as a muqarnas slab and intersected it with relaxed geometry. Fig. 38: A dome created out of (simple) mesh tesselation Fig. 39: A dome created out of mesh tesselation This time it worked with both different tessellations from simple ones to more complex ones and it worked even with asymmetrical shapes at junction of our corridors. Fig. 40: Muqarnas in the non-symmetrical corridors Next to complete the script more material was added to the back of the elements to make them structurally stable and the geometry was intersected with the inner face mesh to reduce the not needed parts. It gave the following result: Fig. 41: Bottom views of possible muqarnas Fig. 42: Side view of posssible muqarnas So lastly this method was further developed and some experimenting took place with tessellations and how they would influence the muqarnas. Best was if there weren't too many different pieces so a maximum of 8 different kind of elements is prefered, so there are not more than 8 kinds of molds. The first approach was by using diamond-shaped muqarnas. All the muqarnas were placed in two different number of levels. Overall it looked very beautiful, but there were too many elements. Fig. 43: Diamond shape muqarnas. Different sizes with different amounts of elements Fig. 44: The result in 3D. Very nice looks, but a lot of elements (12) Another tessellation that was tested, also had a lot of beauty in it. Then again, as this resulted in a few less elements (9 in stead of 12), the amount of elements was still too high Fig. 45: Another approach, less elements and fairly complicated design The next tessellation was picked carefully and was more based on the hexagon. Even with a smaller scale muqarna, still there are only 4 elements to build it with. This makes it constructable and it seems a very nice option. Also, the looks of it are still very beautiful. Fig. 46: The \"final\" tesselation that results in only 4 elements Fig. 47: The bigger size is chosen to allow for easier constructability. If there are machines at hand, the smaller one is also an possiblity","title":"2_Forming"},{"location":"forming/#forming","text":"The translation from the Bubble diagram and concept to the shape Sometimes pictures are too small for their quality, feel free to open them in a new tab In this chapter we give our results on how we went from bubblediagram and the results of 1_Configuration into a 3D shape.

Fig. 28: Stresses in the dynamic relaxed stoa As can be seen there are some stresses and the shape isn't perfect for compression-only building. Therefore, its thickness is structurally optimized. In this way the final shape of the semi-open space is constructed.

Go to scripts There were several approaches to designing the hothouse, where the first was from a geometrical perspective. The hexagon is translated into a normal dome using pendentives. Technically this is the same technique that is used for the normal domes but with a bit nicer translation. Fig. 31: Geometrical perspective; a normal dome on top of pendentives When tesselating the dome and using prisms as small voxels, the dome could start looking like muqarnas. This was the first approach towards reaching the desired muqarnas. Also the pendentives are given a diameter to translate the whole dome into a 3D object. Fig. 32: Geometrical perspective; a normal dome with small prisms Then the Karbandi was combined with the Murqarnas dome. Already it became clear how nice muqarnas could look and how great the potential was. The following picture has clearly repetitive elements that combined form the dome. Fig. 33: Geometrical perspective; a section and bottom view of the muqarna potential The last step in the geometrical approach was also implementing muqarnas on the pendentives. The whole dome now consists of these elements and looks like the following figure. Fig. 34: Geometrical perspective; the whole dome translated into muqarnas From this approach a few things could be learned. Firstly, the geometrical way isn't ideal, as it cannot be combined with the tessellation and is still a normal dome on top of pendentives. Building these can be very hard and might only make matters worse. Secondly, the geometry cannot be simulated easily. To adjust the height and width of the form finding geometry, sliders are used. Also, having the dynamic relaxed shape as input for our dome is prefered. Lastly, this will also follow the other reasons a bit, the geometrical approach only works with point-symmetrical shapes. Concluded, it is important to take the shape of the dome as input. Or using the tessellation or by using the dynamic relaxed mesh. So first the dynamic relaxed mesh is used as input of the dome. When extruding the grid (of 0.4 meter) into the Z-direction, prisms can be created and then intersected with the relaxed geometry. This should then give the prisms as bounding boxes of the muqarnas, whereafter the muqarna structure can be implemented. Fig. 35: Topological perspective: A dome created out of prisms It can be seen that this is not the ideal way of creating this shape. The height is here put into a solid distance, but also when making variable heights, it will be messy. The picture shows a lot of weird prisms on the long edges that are problematic. The whole shape is not point-symmetric anymore. The other disadvantage is that the dome doesn't follow the tessellation. Next the tessellation as input is tried to create the dome. Fig. 36: Topological perspective: A dome created out of the tessellation As can be seen the problem with this approach is, that it is following the logic of muqarnas in opposite direction. And instead of giving thickness to the lower levels it is giving thickness to upper ones so it is not constructable. After this, the tessellation is divided for each layer. However this produces unexpected errors at the corners and in addition it works only for simple symmetrical shapes. Fig. 37: Topological perspective: A dome created out of layered tessellation In the last approach each offset of the mesh tessellation was defined as a muqarnas slab and intersected it with relaxed geometry. Fig. 38: A dome created out of (simple) mesh tesselation Fig. 39: A dome created out of mesh tesselation This time it worked with both different tessellations from simple ones to more complex ones and it worked even with asymmetrical shapes at junction of our corridors. Fig. 40: Muqarnas in the non-symmetrical corridors Next to complete the script more material was added to the back of the elements to make them structurally stable and the geometry was intersected with the inner face mesh to reduce the not needed parts. It gave the following result: Fig. 41: Bottom views of possible muqarnas Fig. 42: Side view of posssible muqarnas So lastly this method was further developed and some experimenting took place with tessellations and how they would influence the muqarnas. Best was if there weren't too many different pieces so a maximum of 8 different kind of elements is prefered, so there are not more than 8 kinds of molds. The first approach was by using diamond-shaped muqarnas. All the muqarnas were placed in two different number of levels. Overall it looked very beautiful, but there were too many elements. Fig. 43: Diamond shape muqarnas. Different sizes with different amounts of elements Fig. 44: The result in 3D. Very nice looks, but a lot of elements (12) Another tessellation that was tested, also had a lot of beauty in it. Then again, as this resulted in a few less elements (9 in stead of 12), the amount of elements was still too high Fig. 45: Another approach, less elements and fairly complicated design The next tessellation was picked carefully and was more based on the hexagon. Even with a smaller scale muqarna, still there are only 4 elements to build it with. This makes it constructable and it seems a very nice option. Also, the looks of it are still very beautiful. Fig. 46: The \"final\" tesselation that results in only 4 elements Fig. 47: The bigger size is chosen to allow for easier constructability. If there are machines at hand, the smaller one is also an possiblity","title":"Murqarnas"},{"location":"introduction/","text":"Introduction: Hammam \"Jannat Al Tohr\" \"Our aim is to create a relaxation place in which showering and bathing facilities will be available to residents. A way of escaping the camp and find themselves in a calming environment.\" The syrian civil war which erupted in March 2011 has created one of the largest humanitarian problem of our time. More than 6.6 million syrians, have been forced to flee from their homes (Mercy Corps, 2018) causing them to be the largest refugee population in the world. While these refugees have been forced to scattered all over the world, with most of the refugees finding their way to camps in Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan. One of these camps is the Zaatari camp, located in the north of Jordan. This camp was opened to the refugees on 28 July 2012. With an initial population of 15000 in 2012, Zaatari now hosts 76414 people (UNHCR,2019). During its 7 years of existence, the camp is slowly changing from a temporary camp to a more permanent settlement. This change was driven by the wish of the inhabitants to have better living conditions, this started when the tents were exchanged for container houses. The residents then started to further improve their homes sometimes through illegally dismantling the public washing facilities. To guide the further development of the camp a better method has to be found to enable the residents wish while keeping in mind the limited resources in the camp, by making the most of the materials available. This report will focus on bringing back a little bit of luxury in the camp, a way of escaping the camp and find themselves in a calming environment. New bathing facilities in a relaxation place will be available to residents, allowing for some luxury, but also going back to their cultural history. Where hammams are important as a former cultural feature. Concept: Reduce the waste water, provide it in recreational places (water usage) Revive the former cultural feature of hammam Improve the hygiene situation Increase the green spaces Create missing relaxation areas Therefore, we called our project Jannat Al Tohr. Jannat means \"Garden\" or \"Paradise\" and al Tohr means \"of cleansiness\" or \"of rest\" . Flowcharts This process was done in three big steps. The first being the configuration, the forming and the structuring. Basicly configuration can be translated as the process of going from concept to a layout of the building, with concepts that can be used as input for the next phase. The next phase is forming, which translated the layout into a 3D shape. Structuring contained the validation of this shape, optimization and translating the shape into smaller components, bricks. Of course, some of the processes aren't contained in one phase and can collide a bit. This process can be summed up in the following flowcharts. To get into the project, first an analysis was done of the camp. A topic, the Hammam was chosen, and research was done to the topology of Hammam and the location. Location analysis created possible locations and the topology of the Hammam was translated into the bubble diagram. This location and the bubblediagram are the input for the configuration\"game\". A triangular grid is used and on these the ruleset is applied. This results in a (simple) mesh. Fig. 1: Flowchart of the configuring/forming With this (simple) mesh, quickly could be derived that there are 4 main categories that need development. The dome, the walls, the openings and the stoa.

Fig. 2: Flowchart of the openings Then for all the elements bricklaying needs to be developed, both in detail as in construction methods. The choice is made with several considerations. These are shown in the following flowchart. Fig. 3: Bricklaying considerations Develop the openings From the 2_Forming chapter in Rule N13 and N14 the doors and ventilation openings are added. Figure 4 and 5 show the doors and openings in the Hammam. Fig. 4: Doors in the Hammam Fig. 5: Openings in the Hammam Bricklaying First off, the doors are designed. The doors can be added in two different ways. Perpendicular on the wall or following the grid. For both options are some good arguments; perpendicular allows for a more natural feel, is easier to construct and probably is more sturdy. Following the grid is probably better for bricklaying, might be a little harder to construct, but allows for a bit of privacy with the direction of the doors. 5 experiments with doors are portrayed here: Fig. 6: 3 options for doors 1) Semi-circular with header layer Easy to set out, formwork can be produced cheaply e.g. with the help of a drum, even joint width, not the most effective arch since it produces a high amount of lateral thrust. 2) Semi-circular arch with stretcher layer Similar to archway #1, the stretcher course offers a larger area for accommodating loads from above. 3) Two-pointed arch with keystone Setout is sophisticated, formwork from timber or bricks required, keystone helps to reduce the width of joints. More structural effective form since the loads are transferred more vertical reducing lateral thrust. Fig. 7: 2 options for doors 4) Shifted two-pointed arch with keystone Similar to archway #3 but with shifted singular arches in order to accommodate archways with non- orthogonal base plan. 5) Inverted catenary arch with keystone Most sophisticated set out, special formwork required. Most structural form since resulting loads are almost vertically transferred into the foundations. Despite keystone the mortar joints are occasionally very wide. Conclusion: The decision which archway to choose fell in favour to the Two-pointed arch with keystone since it offers a structural advantage in comparison with the semi-circle arch while its set-out is not as complicated as the structural superior catenary arch. Anyway, in all the options, following the grid always won versus the perpendicular approach. For this arch a script was developed. The script for wall bricklaying If clicking doesn't download, please save the link as a .gh file For the windows a same technique has been used. 5 different options are designed to choose from. Fig. 8: 3 options for windows 1) Circular window with stretcher layer_ Circular window can be set out easily, formwork can be produced cheaply e.g. with the help of a pipe, small opening size, uneven and wide joint widths are likely to crack. 2) Hexagonal window with stretcher layer of triangular bricks Set out based on geometry only, formwork can be produced by loosely stacked bricks possible, big opening size, keystone is likely to fall out. 3) Hexagonal window with stretcher layer of trapezoidal bricks Set out based on geometry only, formwork can be produced by loosely stacked bricks possible, medium opening size. Fig. 9: 2 options for windows 4) Triangular window with stretcher layer of triangular and trapezoidal bricks Set out based on geometry only, formwork not necessary, several small openings. 5) Triangular window with stretcher layer of shifted triangular and trapezoidal bricks Similar to #4 but with shifted sets of openings offering more privacy than the previous versions. Conclusion: We decided for the option no. 4. Since it the triangular window from stretcher layers of shifted triangular and trapezoidal bricks offers the necessary privacy on the inside while allowing for the necessary ventilation. Fig. 10: A more clear way of construction the walls Construction To continue the construction, the walls are build up until the lowest brick of the archway. Figure 11 clearly shows how the door fits perfectly within the grid and why this is an easier option than using perpendicular openings. Fig. 11: Build until doorheight The next step is to measure the archway in. As the Two-pointed arch with keystone is used, a small pin can be placed on the corner of the wall. A piece of rope can be placed until the other corner. Rotating the rope creates a perfect circle, and doing this for both corners will ensure the Two-pointed arch. When building some small foamwork is needed to hold both sides together. After 1 arch is done, applying mortar against the last arch makes sure that shape is good and it will not fall.

The chosen topic was and remains very relevant. The included lectures were often very beneficial, in few cases superficial. The brick workshop was very entertaining and provided a better understanding of the adobe material. For more valuable results at the subsequent brick testing the organisation of the workshop could have been more stringent. The support of the docents was often helpful and in cases highly enjoyable. The midterm presentation proved vital to check that the project was going into the right correction. The topic of the hammam was appreciated by all team members with the special focus on the muqarnas and stoa a special challenge for the more experienced team members. The team work was smooth. In summary the course was interesting and motivating to learn more about computational design. Reflection Nikoleta Project: The development of the project was challenging. The triangular grid resulted to interesting space configuration. The most difficult part was to transform the project from 2D to 3D, in this phase the triangular grid created extra complexity in defining basic elements in the 3D Geometry and to complex scripts were developed,, wich our laptops had difficulties to process. By internalizing the data the processing demands got reduces but not enough. The most difficult part was the overall ceiling. Three different way were tried to create this geometry and in the end dynamic relaxation was chosen the best one. However, this geometry has many potentials to be developed further. Course: The curse was structured with deliverables for almost every week. However the guidance from the tutors was not in time or was missing many times. In the configuration phase in the 1st week everything was unclear what we should do. We were informed about the importance of a proper tesselation in dynamic relaxation two days before midterm. After midterm in the challenge of transforming the 2D in 3D extra challenges were added and in the end there was no time to organize the project for the final presentation. During the consultation all the tutors were passing by separately. In these days we were explaining the project 3 to 4 times in the different tutors and the feedbacks were not aligning in the same direction in basic things because the tutors were not informed about the tutors. Consulting with all the tutors at the shame time would have brought better results. Reflection Hamidreza Project: The hammam project was very interesting. In this project beside knowing about construction with adobe we learned many things about how people did waterproofing, ventilation and heating in the adobe building. Using triangular grid was very challenging and it changed my bias toward symmetrical adobe buildings which I used to see in my country. The combination of using this grid, building a 3d form from it, and the muqarnas helped me to grasp the difference between geometry and topology and the benefits of the topological approach in design. Reflection Max Project: The triangular grid was challenging and interesting to solve. However : After working with an diagrid last semester and this semester with and triangular grid, I will try to avoid them for a certain time. A rectangular grid is easier to handle and offer good solutions as well. The construction is possible but a bit too complicated for my taste, especially when we consider the unskilled labor. We believe it is possible but I think a more basic construction would be more suitable. But since we tried to achieve adobe 2.0 and not a standard solution I think that the production could be further simplified with more time. Course: The course required us to have a steep learning curve. I would have preferred getting the course brief earlier. That way i could have prepared myself better already during the summer vacation. The tutorings where inspiring and offered multiple different perspectives how to solve certain problems. This way we could decide what suits us the best. The teaching approach was pushing us towards ur limits and resulted in a good project. I enjoyed working with my team members on this course. Reflection Rick Project: I must say, I really liked the project, the triangular grid and the complexity of it. I like to push towards the boundaries and to there where my comfort zone stops. But in this project i think we did a great job, especially with the topic of the Hammam. I'm almost convinced that a lot of choices we made are very logical and can easily compete with rectangular grids. There are a lot of benefits of it, although it brought us some complex mindset. I liked how everything played out and think we can be proud of it. Course: The course has a lot of very hard assets and require a lot of focus and insight. I loved that the teachers didn't push us back and that we were able to develop our own thing, something I see sometimes missing in TU. I learned a lot from the teachers, how they spoke to us. Also the amount of teachers and the different ones was interesting. A critique was sometimes the weird directions that were given, that didn't seem to make things easier (e.g. implementing combined Grasshopper scripts and the tesselations a day before midterms). Also I liked my team and a big shout-out to Hamid and his tea :) Reflection Noah Looking back on earthy there are a few things that come to mind about the course. The first one being that I was lucky to be part of a great group, where everyone did what they could. Not all of us had the much prior knowledge about grasshopper and programming but everyone made an effort to better themselves. In my case this meant that I tried to understand python and I\u2019m slowly getting an idea of how to work with it, but I\u2019m not at the point where I can make a script that I more useful then a couple of grasshopper components. I can however say with certainty that I improved my grasshopper skills, I learned how to work with Karamba and got a better understanding of how to work with the data structures in grasshopper. The second thing that comes to mind is are the lectures and tutoring, because there was such a large amount of knowledge that had to be transferred to us students it sometimes became very hard to follow and comprehend the what was being taught. Some lectures lasting for multiple hours without breaks did not help. During counselling the given feedback was mostly helpful and it can be a good thing to be pushed to take a step further in the design and really thinking about the logic behind it but being pushed to improve the design while one already feels the pressure of what has to be done still can be very stress inducing. All in all I believe that earthy has a lot of potential to be a great course but there needs to be more clarity about what the final result should be, a design or a method.

The triangular grid resulted to interesting space configuration. The most difficult part was to transform the project from 2D to 3D, in this phase the triangular grid created extra complexity in defining basic elements in the 3D Geometry and to complex scripts were developed,, wich our laptops had difficulties to process. By internalizing the data the processing demands got reduces but not enough. The most difficult part was the overall ceiling. Three different way were tried to create this geometry and in the end dynamic relaxation was chosen the best one. However, this geometry has many potentials to be developed further. Course: The curse was structured with deliverables for almost every week. However the guidance from the tutors was not in time or was missing many times. In the configuration phase in the 1st week everything was unclear what we should do. We were informed about the importance of a proper tesselation in dynamic relaxation two days before midterm. After midterm in the challenge of transforming the 2D in 3D extra challenges were added and in the end there was no time to organize the project for the final presentation. During the consultation all the tutors were passing by separately. In these days we were explaining the project 3 to 4 times in the different tutors and the feedbacks were not aligning in the same direction in basic things because the tutors were not informed about the tutors. Consulting with all the tutors at the shame time would have brought better results.","title":"Reflection Nikoleta"},{"location":"reflection/#reflection-hamidreza","text":"Project: The hammam project was very interesting.

However : After working with an diagrid last semester and this semester with and triangular grid, I will try to avoid them for a certain time. A rectangular grid is easier to handle and offer good solutions as well. The construction is possible but a bit too complicated for my taste, especially when we consider the unskilled labor. We believe it is possible but I think a more basic construction would be more suitable. But since we tried to achieve adobe 2.0 and not a standard solution I think that the production could be further simplified with more time. Course: The course required us to have a steep learning curve. I would have preferred getting the course brief earlier. That way i could have prepared myself better already during the summer vacation. The tutorings where inspiring and offered multiple different perspectives how to solve certain problems.

I liked how everything played out and think we can be proud of it. Course: The course has a lot of very hard assets and require a lot of focus and insight. I loved that the teachers didn't push us back and that we were able to develop our own thing, something I see sometimes missing in TU. I learned a lot from the teachers, how they spoke to us. Also the amount of teachers and the different ones was interesting.

The first one being that I was lucky to be part of a great group, where everyone did what they could. Not all of us had the much prior knowledge about grasshopper and programming but everyone made an effort to better themselves. In my case this meant that I tried to understand python and I\u2019m slowly getting an idea of how to work with it, but I\u2019m not at the point where I can make a script that I more useful then a couple of grasshopper components. I can however say with certainty that I improved my grasshopper skills, I learned how to work with Karamba and got a better understanding of how to work with the data structures in grasshopper. The second thing that comes to mind is are the lectures and tutoring, because there was such a large amount of knowledge that had to be transferred to us students it sometimes became very hard to follow and comprehend the what was being taught. Some lectures lasting for multiple hours without breaks did not help. During counselling the given feedback was mostly helpful and it can be a good thing to be pushed to take a step further in the design and really thinking about the logic behind it but being pushed to improve the design while one already feels the pressure of what has to be done still can be very stress inducing. All in all I believe that earthy has a lot of potential to be a great course but there needs to be more clarity about what the final result should be, a design or a method.

First the focus is on how all the walls will look like. Then it will explain the bricklaying patterns and the process of building it. Flowchart In the 0_Introduction chapter the whole process of the design was shown. There were 5 groups that were dealt with individually. The walls are relatively simple. The process behind the walls is showed in this flowchart. Fig. 2: Flowchart of the walls Then for all the elements bricklaying needs to be developed, both in detail as in construction methods. The choice is made with several considerations. These are shown in the following flowchart. Fig. 3: Bricklaying considerations Develop the walls From the 2_Forming chapter in Rule N11 the wall thickness and height is added. From the configuration hexagons work well with making quite easy builds. The main idea of the design is that the hexagons are extruded vertically and then domes are built on top of them. This is realisable as hexagons are easier with this than rectangles are. The walls are therefore in shape quite easy. There are four different kinds of domes, so there are also four types of wall-thicknesses. In the structural report the following diagram was shown: Fig. 4: Diagram for wall thicknesses In this picture it shows that there are 4 different kind of wall thicknesses, depending on the dome size. These thicknesses are 0.5m, 0,8m, 1.0m and 1.2m. The whole Hammam is made with these sizes, to make it a bit doable and understandable on how to do bricklaying in the project. Fig. 5: The walls without extrusion Bricklaying The flowchart in Figure 3 shows the considerations between rectancular bricks and triangular bricks. The first input is the brick size. Considering the optimal brick form and dimension it was decided to start with a rectangular brick of 40 x 20 x 10 cm since this brick proportion is beneficial to form steps and lies under the maximum weight limit that a mason can handle. The necessary wall thickness was based on the rule of thumb that an adobe wall of a dome should be one sixth of the dome diameter. Since the domes were designed with 2.4, 4.8, 7.2 and 9.6m diameter, the thicknesses was assumed to be at least 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2m. The wall thickness of 0.4m was omitted due to practical reasons, this thickness does not offer sufficient surface area to place vaults on top. Subsequently standard brick patterns as they have been used for centuries e.g. the half, cross and Flemish bond were tested for the number of necessary off-cuts. The design of the hammam is featured through hexagons so it was checked how the various wall thickness and bonds perform on the many sixty degree corners. As expected the result was that the rectangular brick bonds required a various number of off-cuts. However the number of off-cuts required was disappointing. In addition the same procedure was performed with rammed earth wall constructions but the result was again a high level off cuts. Even the application of tailor-made bricks was not satisfying. An even a higher number off-cuts was expected for the 120 degree corners for the archways. Fig. 6: In white the off-cuts are shown, per layer this already results in 24 off-cut bricks Fig. 7: In white the off-cuts are shown, per layer around 18 off-cut bricks The higher the number of off-cut bricks the less effective is the wall construction. Considering the triangular grid of the project the idea was obvious to run the same procedure with equivalent triangular bricks. When staggering the bricks above each other and rotating them alternately by 60 degrees a bond was achieved. By doing so the wall edges were graded. Here another trapezoidal brick had to be introduced so that smooth walls can be achieved. The triangular brick in combination with the small trapezoidal brick required no off-cuts to produce the 60 degree corners, independent from the wall thickness. For compatibility the triangular wall dimensions were modelled close to the rectangular brick, with side lines of 40cm and a height of 10cm. This resulted in the following bricklaying patterns: Fig. 8: Using triangular bricks will result in having no cutt-off bricks There is one following of this, that is the bricksize is following the triangular grid. As the grid used, consists 0.4 meters, the height of the brick is an irrational number, as it is the sqrt of 0.12. With the trapezoid in this, there will always be wall thicknesses with the sizes: (n + 1/3) * sqrt(0,12) , where n is the amount of bricks in the width. But this is not a problem, as the new thicknesses are actually quite useful. It will result in thicknesses of (rounded) 0.5m , 0.8m and 1,2meters. For the smallest walls it is not a problem if they are scaled down to 0.5 meters thickness and for the 1meter wall something else will need to be thought of. This is done by using infill, a bit like the roman style. Rammed earth isn't prefered, since it might not settle and foamwork is required. By using rectangular bricks in the infill, the perfect width is reached. Fig. 9: Also fill-in can be used The result for the 120 degree corners of the archways were equally positive. It was advised to dull the sharp corners to reduce injuries and prevent the edge to break off. The triangular brick bond allows to dull the edge easily with only every second brick to be slightly amended i.e. cutting off a small protruding edge. Fig. 10: Corners For the walls, the decision was made to stick with the triangular bricks, for quite obvious reasons. The only thing that could change this decision is if there are hard problems with doors. In the hexagons there are 6 smaller elements that combined form the hexagon. When combining all the triangles it is important that it can also be mirrored, as the bricks should switch every layer. By using these 6 elements, each layer can be mirrored and thus a sturdy wall can be realised. Fig. 11: Each element will look like this Fig. 12: And combined they are mirrored For this project a script was developed that included all of our approach. Go to scripts Construction So to construct the wall, first the foundation has to be built. The first step is setting out the hexagon on the site. In this example, a hexagon with a diameter of 9.6 meter is used. Fig. 13: Setting out the hexagon on site To set out the hexagon, residents of the camp can easily do it without very hard tools. The following steps should be taken: Fig. 14: Setting out the hexagon on site 1) Determining the center of the hexagon and pound in a steel post. Tying a rope to the base of the post. Tying a steel pole to the other end of the rope. The length of the out-stretched rope will be the radius of the circle for the hexagon. 2)By stretching the rope, drawing a circle with a steel pole attached to the other end of the rope, just like making a circle with a compass. 3)Setting a post on the circular line to determine the first corner of the hexagon. 4)Using the same length of the radius to determine the next corner point of the hexagon. 5)Working from one point to the next using the same length of the radius. 6)The precision can be checked by working from the same starting point but in the other direction. 7)A perfect hexagon is established. It is advisable to cover the tops of the steel rods with a ball or a plastic bottle in order to make them visible and to prevent injuries. Then, measure another 70 centimeters around the hexagon. More space is needed to make sure the foundation is accessible and later on functions as a chimney and is needed for the excess of moisture. Then dig out the needed ground. Fig. 15: Measure an extra 70 centimeters Fig. 16: Dig out 1 meter deep. Now make the foundation with rocks. Make sure this goes a little wider on the bottom, as shown in figure 18. Normal rocks are sufficient to build this foundation. Fig. 17: Make the foundation. Fig. 18: Section of the foundation. Now start building the wall. This is the wall until ground level, that follows the bricklaying that has been discussed before. Build vaults in the inner place, they are needed for floor heating, but also for moist. These are build like normal vaults, more on that is found in the corridor chapter. Lastly fill everything up with earth, so that a smooth floor is the result.

The only thing that could change this decision is if there are hard problems with doors. In the hexagons there are 6 smaller elements that combined form the hexagon. When combining all the triangles it is important that it can also be mirrored, as the bricks should switch every layer. By using these 6 elements, each layer can be mirrored and thus a sturdy wall can be realised. Fig. 11: Each element will look like this Fig. 12: And combined they are mirrored For this project a script was developed that included all of our approach.

In this example, a hexagon with a diameter of 9.6 meter is used. Fig. 13: Setting out the hexagon on site To set out the hexagon, residents of the camp can easily do it without very hard tools. The following steps should be taken: Fig. 14: Setting out the hexagon on site 1) Determining the center of the hexagon and pound in a steel post. Tying a rope to the base of the post. Tying a steel pole to the other end of the rope. The length of the out-stretched rope will be the radius of the circle for the hexagon. 2)By stretching the rope, drawing a circle with a steel pole attached to the other end of the rope, just like making a circle with a compass. 3)Setting a post on the circular line to determine the first corner of the hexagon. 4)Using the same length of the radius to determine the next corner point of the hexagon. 5)Working from one point to the next using the same length of the radius. 6)The precision can be checked by working from the same starting point but in the other direction. 7)A perfect hexagon is established. It is advisable to cover the tops of the steel rods with a ball or a plastic bottle in order to make them visible and to prevent injuries. Then, measure another 70 centimeters around the hexagon. More space is needed to make sure the foundation is accessible and later on functions as a chimney and is needed for the excess of moisture. Then dig out the needed ground. Fig. 15: Measure an extra 70 centimeters Fig. 16: Dig out 1 meter deep. Now make the foundation with rocks. Make sure this goes a little wider on the bottom, as shown in figure 18. Normal rocks are sufficient to build this foundation. Fig. 17: Make the foundation. Fig. 18: Section of the foundation. Now start building the wall. This is the wall until ground level, that follows the bricklaying that has been discussed before. Build vaults in the inner place, they are needed for floor heating, but also for moist. These are build like normal vaults, more on that is found in the corridor chapter. Lastly fill everything up with earth, so that a smooth floor is the result.

Combining the expected size and best locations is therefore the main structure of our flowchart, as shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 1: Basic structure of the flowchart in week 2 Location Creating an Hammam in the camp will require some thinking about the location. Already in week 1 we defined the important points where the Hammam should be placed. Density and Walking distance being the most important ones. We created an algorythm to find the best spots for the Hammam, using previously described parameters. Density was calculated with the density map , loaded into the Image Sampler of Grasshopper. The inverse of Density overall means more space to use and less families to bribe/offer alternatives. Walking distance was determined as, the closer to the centre of a district, the better. Also the other attractionpoints have been taken in account. A grid was made for the entire camp and the algorythm gave a result for each point (the higher - better).

Fig. 3: Flowchart towards finding the locations Size Now we have a lot of possible locations, we need to know the size of the plot to compare with the location and make a PoR. Firstly we analysed the topography of \"Bathhouse\" and how they work, which resulted in some depth charts After reviewing the depth charts and layouts of the bathhouses and other hammam, we chose a \"standard\" Hammam to design with. Fig. 4: Layout and depth charts of several bathhouses For this Hammam we created a depth chart, which became imput for the Bubble Diagram, together with the needed rooms. Fig. 5: The bubble diagram working with random sizes Program of requirements To estimate the size 5 different historical hammam are analyzed. The Garineh Kohne, Golshan, Dorod, Chekneh and the Kaboli Hammam. The spaces of the mentioned hammams were separated into following functions: dressing room, corridors, hot house, outdoor pool and the subsidiary room. This way we could find out how much percentages of the total floor plan each function requires. This can be seen in the figure \u201crequired space per function analysis_percentages per function\u201d.

We will develop ways of going from space - shape. This is a process that can be done on many ways, both manual and computational. This weeks objective is to check these processes and try to get a basic map. The bubble diagram is the input for these processes, as we say this configuration of the rooms is optimal or at least close to the most functional layout of the building. In week 2 we created the expected flowchart for this week. Concluding, this week should be about reading into masonry techniques, some preparations for the brick making and going from space to shape. Masonry To eventually make the translation to a buildable adobe building, we need to look into masonry. Eventually this turned out to be a bit of a chicken-and-egg-problem, as the structures should influence the grid, but the grid should also influence the structures chosen. We decided that the shape, and therefore the grid, is the more important one. Nevertheless we also looked into different kinds of vaults, domes, bricks and sections. The main conclusions about roofs can be found in the following picture: Fig. 1: Possibilities of vaults/domes We realised that to achieve a builable building we have to read into these vaults and how they are constructed. Its not only about the end result, but it should also hold mid-construction. Reading into this is also very important. During one of our sessions we also discussed the possibility of digging into the ground to build. It has some good features, shown in Fig 2 . Fig. 1: Possibilities of vaults/domes Shape To go from space to shape several paths can be taken to get to a shape and mesh. Several discussions have taken place to get to a basic floorplan and how to get there. This will show some experimenting we did this week to get into designing the hammam. The first approach we tried is a literal translation of the bubblediagram into a shape. Circles are a great start for compression-only buildings and therefore might work really well. Then we want to add some qualities in the spaces, such as corridors, free height and optical connections. To do this, we divide the plot in a grid with a lot of points and for each point calculate the \"importance\" of each point of being built. For example, the centre of the circle should have 100% of the height, a point on the edge of the circle has a lower importance and can be built with maybe a 20% height. Points close to a roomconnection should have higher importance, to allow for corridors to exist. When giving the freeheight as an input ( Fig 3 ) all the points in the box are also considered \"more important\". Overall added (with some factors) this gives a heatmap with importances, seen in Fig 4 . This is a potential approach to get an interesting floorplan which might be good for compression-only building. To show the potential we plotted our bubblediagram and moved the points up with x^2 (an approach to cartesian curve, only for presentation purposes) to show how the hammam might look. It was an interesting point of looking at it, but we quickly realized it was never buildable. With only inexperienced builders, we have to come up with something more understandable. Fig. 3: Importance of the bubble diagram Fig. 4: Importance of the hallways Fig. 6: Importance of the free height Fig. 6: Added imporances to an organic shape Fig. 6: An example of our bubblediagram, where imporance is heightened under x^2 We realised that this shape is not optimal, for the reason that unskilled people have to build this. We decided to not futher develop computational ways of getting to a floorplan, and leave computational interventions for later on. However this experiment was far from useless. It gave an iteresting view on how the whole building might look like and gave a better look towards the garden and the open spaces. The next path we took was with the Magnetizing floor plan generator, a plugin that translates bubble diagram into spaces within a boundary. It sounds really interesting to use but had some flaws that made the plugin not suitable for our project. The main flaw is the use of corridors, we planned out 3 \"hallways\" to function as the main places within the building (the entrance, the garden and the hammam hall), but implementing this was super hard. Secondly, the maximum rooms allowed in this plugin is 15, where we have more rooms. Lastly, the plugin doesn't give perfect, usable floorplans, but merely a more interesting to look at floorplan, that is equal to the bubblediagram. We tried the plugin with the boundary and that gave around 20 different configurations. These gave very interesting insights in the building and how we should (and or could) configurate the building. Fig. 7: Possible configurations by the Magnetizing floor plan tool Fig. 8: 4 combinations, from which 2 were rendered without corridors What can we learn from these 2 computational approaches? First of all these gave optional designs of our Hammam, which is always a nice start. But we did not do these approaches with this reasoning. The first approach was really experimental and might not create an easy-to-build building, but it made us think about how you could design with compression-only building. The result was not usable, but it gave a clear view on how the garden could be used. The building would become a bit of 2 buildings in one with a garden inbetween. The second thing we saw was that having a lot of solo \"iglos\" could give a nice view, but it's very messy and this might not reflect original Hammam well. From the magnetizing tool we learned what was a logical by computer to divide the building. This was done with rectangles, from which we all realised it was not conform the topology. Also, when looking at the figure 7 , all of the configurations have a corridor around the garden. This might be an interesting feature of the building that we'd like to use in the building. So concluding: The garden should be the glue inbetween 2 functions Look into roofing and don't create 15 different \"iglos\" Create a corridor around the garden Manual shape We decided it made more sense to create the shape by hand, as we explored some computational approaches which didn't gave the results we hoped. This opened the discussion on how we'd develop the grid. From the more classical hammam we saw that round shapes or polygons were commonly used. (For reference check this link ) Also, it would have a kind of elegance that fit well with the hammam where we like to bring some luxury back in the lives of the habitants. From a structural point of view, polygons are quite allright, as they consist out of triangles. This would make it buildable and suitable for compression-only building. So from the topology we'd prefer to have an polygonal grid, more specific a hexogonal grid. The main issue is shown in Fig 9 . Rectangular grids allow for distribution of horizontal forces and to cancel out with the next arch on the grid. This is not really possible with the hexogonal grid. Because of this, from a structural point of view, we'd prefer the rectangular grid. Also; its way easier to design using arches and vaults, seen in the masonry paragraph . Fig. 9: The use of more arches (Joffroy, 1994) After discussing we decided that topology should be more important and we should try to get it structural buildable, while it doesn't get to complicated. This allows for it to achieve elegance in the design, having a challenge and having hexagons as \"our thing\". On the other hand, if on the end of next week, we dont have it working, we should retry with rectangles. For this it is important to work parralel on the 3d shape and on the dynamic relaxation. Brick making This week also contained the brick making. We have a seperate page about this. See this page Next steps We edited the flowchart to be more fitting of this weeks progress. This week we saw two ways of configuration that were done computational. We also researched a lot into masonry, which will influence the shape. For now, the forming process looked like this: Fig. 10: Bubble Diagram of the program of requirements As previously written, next week is an important one that should determine if a hexogonal grid is reachable, but more important buidable. Developing a grid by hand and structural solutions are key in this process. For next week, we should develop a shape that we will go with before wednesday.

Also, when looking at the figure 7 , all of the configurations have a corridor around the garden. This might be an interesting feature of the building that we'd like to use in the building. So concluding: The garden should be the glue inbetween 2 functions Look into roofing and don't create 15 different \"iglos\" Create a corridor around the garden","title":"Shape"},{"location":"week3/#manual-shape","text":"We decided it made more sense to create the shape by hand, as we explored some computational approaches which didn't gave the results we hoped. This opened the discussion on how we'd develop the grid. From the more classical hammam we saw that round shapes or polygons were commonly used. (For reference check this link ) Also, it would have a kind of elegance that fit well with the hammam where we like to bring some luxury back in the lives of the habitants. From a structural point of view, polygons are quite allright, as they consist out of triangles. This would make it buildable and suitable for compression-only building. So from the topology we'd prefer to have an polygonal grid, more specific a hexogonal grid. The main issue is shown in Fig 9 . Rectangular grids allow for distribution of horizontal forces and to cancel out with the next arch on the grid. This is not really possible with the hexogonal grid. Because of this, from a structural point of view, we'd prefer the rectangular grid. Also; its way easier to design using arches and vaults, seen in the masonry paragraph . Fig. 9: The use of more arches (Joffroy, 1994) After discussing we decided that topology should be more important and we should try to get it structural buildable, while it doesn't get to complicated. This allows for it to achieve elegance in the design, having a challenge and having hexagons as \"our thing\". On the other hand, if on the end of next week, we dont have it working, we should retry with rectangles. For this it is important to work parralel on the 3d shape and on the dynamic relaxation.","title":"Manual shape"},{"location":"week3/#brick-making","text":"This week also contained the brick making.

We already had some shapes but weren't fully convinced yet. Slowly into the week, we saw that a triangular grid was achievable and we focussed more on the shape. Therefore, there will be no more talks and comparisons about rectangles and we go all-in on the hexagons. We developed the grid into the final shape, where each edge equals 1.2 meters. This way, the triangles could be combined into corridors, while remaining more than a meter wide (to be precise 1.04m ).

As the building is fully constructed by hexagons, we can easily create domes on top of them. It is also our idea to build almost all the domes by their own, using \"simple\" domes. We will create a \"guide\" on how to build a dome from a hexagon, the building should then look like this: Fig. 5: The domes of the Hammam We want to build a scale model ourselves of this kind of dome, to experience how building this is. The guide should focus on how unskilled people can build it safely and easy. Therefore our domes aren't really interesting and challenging to design. To counter this, we decided to make some things a bit more challenging. Previously was told that the stoa has an important role in the Hammam. It holds everyhing together and can be a pleasing to be place. Therefore we will relax this shape and design in computationally. It will be a nice to look at as it is mathematical logically. Together with the vaults and stoa our Hammam should look like this (take not this is the ceilings, not the roofs): Fig. 5: The vaults and stoa of the Hammam Fig. 5: The final look of the Hammam Also, to challenge us in the compression-only building we will make a piece of the Hammam more challenging.
